# Business-Forecasting-Assignment-2
Repository for data I want to practice forecasting methods on.

- Data Collection Methodology: This data is submitted by Costco to the SEC, a government entity that ensures businesses are accurately filing their financial statements. It provides the 10-Q statement every quarter and the 10-K statement every fiscal year. These records are submitted to ensure that Costco is not performing fraudulent businesses practices.
- This data intrigues me because Costco has a large presence in my life. Much of the groceries that my family and I consume come from the company. Additionally, their unique business model makes its revenue interesting to look at. When I saw the data, I also noticed that Q4 was the quarter with the most revenue compared to the other quarters in the year. As a company that has grown in popularity that sells items in bulk for a cheaper price with a membership, I think it will be interesting to see how the company does in the coming quarters and years.
